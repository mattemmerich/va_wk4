  <div id="STORY">
    <p>
      With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity
      and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great
      husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in
      furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and
      beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".
    </p>

    <p>
      That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood
      chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair,
      now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York
    </p>

    <p>
      Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project
      the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely & to the best of
      your ability, & that way, you might change the world" - Charles Eames
    </p>

    <p>
      The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design
      and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details
      are not details", said Charles. "They make the product".
    </p>

    <p>
      Their own concepts evloved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about
      the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of
      inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".
    </p>

    <p>
      A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to
      make the world a better place". That they did. That also made it a lot more
      interesting.
